          <!-- Step 1 -->
          <article id="step-1">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Identify Indicators</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-800">
              Some indicators could include: food insecurity, clothing or housing needs, physical or mental health issues, addiction, or withdrawal from the community.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-green-800">
              <li>You can’t help someone if you don’t know they are struggling. In addition to physical indicators, subtle indicators such as consistent tiredness, social withdrawal, and less engagement with faith activities can signal that someone needs help.</li>
              <li>Be discreet, respectful, and judgment-free when approaching someone to see if they need help—all people have, and deserve, dignity.</li>
            </ul>
          </article>

          <!-- Step 2 -->
          <article id="step-2">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Address Urgent Needs</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-green-800">
              Help provide or connect people to food, clothing, shelter, medical care, addiction help, community connection, and other immediate needs.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-green-800">
              <li>It is impossible for someone to change if their immediate needs are not being met.</li>
              <li>Use congregational resources such as direct financial assistance and food banks.</li>
              <li>Contact appropriate outside resources from other faiths, nonprofits, and government organizations—a list is available on the resources page.</li>
            </ul>
          </article>

          <!-- Step 4 -->
          <article id="step-4">

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-green-800">
              <li>As a mentor, avoid “fixing” problems—there will always be more. Instead, help people learn to solve their own problems.</li>
              <li>Mentors build a relationship with the individual, share faith principles that encourage self-reliance, help set and support goals with the individual, and help the individual access congregational and community resources.</li>
            </ul>

              <li>Some Christian examples include the inherent value of the human soul, God’s desire for us to become more like Him, the enabling power of Christ to help us do hard things, accountability to God, our responsibility to our families, and the importance of serving others.</li>
